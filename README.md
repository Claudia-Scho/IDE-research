# IDE-RESEARCH

## IDE?
An **integrated development** environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. 

An IDE normally consists of: 

1. a source code editor
2. build automation tools
3. and a debugger

Most of the modern IDEs have intelligent code completion. Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain a compiler, interpreter, or both; others, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus, do not. 

The boundary between an integrated development environment and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined. Sometimes a version control system, or various tools to simplify the construction of a graphical user interface (GUI), are integrated. Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram, for use in object-oriented software development.


## Popular IDE's


### Visual Studio IDE

Visual Studio is a cross-platform environment that comes in three versions: community, professional, and enterprise. If you code in Python, C/C++, C#, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP Extension Pack or Rust, Visual Studio might be the IDE for you.

| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Many useful extensions | Loading times can be slow | $1.199 first year |
| Very user friendly | Help can be time consuming | $799 renewal |
| Debugging tools | Expensive for PRO version | price for 1 user |


### Visual Studio Code

VSCode or also known as Visual Studio Code is a highly versatile coding environment. Out of the box, it’s pretty basic, but the beauty with this IDE is that you can personalize it with just the extensions or plugins that you require, no less, no more. VSCode is powerful, with the ability to cope with a huge array of languages including PHP, C#, Python, TypeScript to name a few. All of these languages have downloadable extensions, and there is also many articles out there, already informing you of whats the best extensions around town.

The golden nugget that comes with VSCode is it’s extremely-epic debugging capabilities, if you’ve ever used Visual Studio Professional before, you’ll already know what I’m talking about, especially if you worked with a web-application. Microsoft’s freely available IDE is a contender of the Atom editor, and it’s made some great competition too.


| Pro's        | Cons           | Price |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Extendable with plug-ins | Slow launch time | **FREE** |
| Integrated terminal | autocomplete and code check is not as powerful |   |
| Debugging | Slow file search |   |


### CLion

CLion is a platform used to create programs in C and C++ that may be best for novices in the programming world. CLion comes with automatic headers and pre-written classes which can either save time or fix silly mistakes. Variables come in different colors so developers can easily find the variables they are looking for.


| Pro's        | Cons           | Price |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Cross platform | Not for free | €199 1st year |
| Intelligent code completion | Help can be time consuming | €159 2nd year |
| Integrated debugger | Expensive for PRO version | €119 3rd year and on |


### NetBeans

NetBeans is a completely free to use IDE that is capable of processing Java, C++, C, PHP programming languages as well as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. If you use it in the right way, it’s intelligent-intellisense feature can be astoundingly powerful, being able to auto-fill not only programming language methods but able to offer auto-fill on your CSS styles, image paths, file paths and much, much more.

NetBeans has in-built FTP & SFTP services, Git integration, code-formatting shortcuts, completely debug-ready for all programming languages and of course the most important, the ability to change themes, for example, darcula! In essence, this IDE has everything you could possibly need from an IDE, and for the power it brings to your development environment, it’s quite hard-to-believe it’s completely free.

| Pro's        | Cons           | Price |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Completely free | Not as many themes for code window | **FREE** |

| Debugging | Loading time multiple projects |   |


### XCode

### Eclipse

Eclipse is an open-source coding environment that has specializations in Java but also supports C/C++, PHP and more. It is more common for programmers to program with Java in Eclipse because of the specialties this IDE has with Java. With Cloud capabilities coders can code globally without fear of losing data. Tools and plug-ins can be easily installed or added by taking a stroll through the Eclipse Marketplace.
